# BMPtoFramebuffer

This program is meant to display a BMP image on the Framebuffer of a Raspberry Pi, to efficiently show the image on a small embedded display. The program will also implement 360-degree rotation, so scanning off the edge of one side of the image will simply wrap back around to the other side, and it will be able to take input from a rotary encoder.
